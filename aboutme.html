          <h1>About Me</h1>h1
         <p>I'm trying to work toward owning a huge fishing chartering business with multiple boats. I grew up working for my dad and for many other captain, fishing is something I like to do and teaching somebody about the hobby is what makes it fun. 

One thing I'm doing to work towards this goal is passing my captains license test, and not trying to get in trouble with the law. If i was to get in trouble with the law it could jeopardize my chance of getting the license. Fishing is also something I'm always doing learning every thing about the backwaters and fishing offshore. 

Values I need for this business is too be respectful to the clients, be helpful and too communicate with them so the trip is fun. Another value I might need is to have a boat that will fit many people. 

I hope to have a decent business going on once I get out of high school with customers that will book charters to have a great time. I hope in the first year I will get some business and I will advertise a lot so my company can grow and have more people and people coming to make good money but also to have a great time fishing and talking. 

When I'm older I want to be known for the charter captain giving a great time on water fishing and maybe showing the wildlife. I would love to be known for teaching little kids how to fish and teach them how to be respectful Youngman.
